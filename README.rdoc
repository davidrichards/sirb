= Sirb

* http://github.com/davidrichards/sirb/tree/master

== DESCRIPTION:

Statistics + IRB.  This offers a series of useful tools that a console should probably have, if your goal is to crunch a few numbers.  It includes all the packages that I use, if you have them.  Statisticus will have a standard library of statistical methods that you may want to have access to, so it's probably worth loading that gem as well.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

=== Statistical Functions

Sirb has a set of rather useful functions setup:

* max 
* min 
* sum 
* mean
* median 
* range  
* variance (also var)
* standard_deviation (also std)
* sort
* rank
* order  
* quantile  
* cumulative_sum (also cum_sum)
* cumulative_product (also cum_prod)
* cumulative_max (also cum_max)
* cumulative_min (also cum_min)

For comparing lists, you can use:

* correlation (also cor)
* p_max  
* p_min

For other things, you can use:

* max
* min
* product
* to_pairs

=== Libraries Loaded

Right now, Sirb attempts to load the following libraries (when available):

* NArray
* RGL
* matrix
* set
* RNum
* Statisticus
* RBTree
* mathn
* This library

=== Stored Procedures

As you work, you can choose to store a procedure and use it between sessions.  I do this with pstore (part of Ruby's standard library) and some code I found on Ruby Quiz by Florian GroÃŸ.  The storage process is a little draconian, so in the short-term, you can call sirb with -w (sirb -w) and this feature is taken away from the runtime.

This is a very useful tool to have if you have some R code that you tend to use often, say, or some other functions that you discover while working with some data.

== SYNOPSIS:

=== Functions

From command line: 
  sirb
  >> @a = [3,2,6,7,14]
  => [3, 2, 6, 7, 14]
  >> @b = [4,6,2,1,19]
  => [4, 6, 2, 1, 19]
  >> @a.max 
  => 14
  >> @a.min 
  => 2
  >> @a.sum
  => 32.0
  >> # Most methods have meaningful block semantics
  ?> @a.sum {|x| x ** x}
  => 1.11120068264282e+16
  >> @a.mean
  => 6.4
  >> @a.median 
  => 6
  >> @a.range  
  => [2, 14]
  >> @a.var
  => 22.3
  >> @a.std
  => 4.72228758124704
  >> @a.sort
  => [2, 3, 6, 7, 14]
  >> @a.rank
  => [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
  >> @a.order  
  => [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
  >> @a.quantile  
  => [2, 3, 6, 7, 14]
  >> @a.cum_sum
  => [3.0, 5.0, 11.0, 18.0, 32.0]
  >> @a.cum_prod
  => [3.0, 6.0, 36.0, 252.0, 3528.0]
  >> @a.cum_max
  => [3, 3, 6, 7, 14]
  >> @a.cum_min
  => [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  >> # And some methods between lists
  ?> cor(@a,@b)
  => 0.755599551729267
  >> # This is the max of each pair (or set)
  ?> p_max(@a,@b)
  => [4, 6, 6, 7, 19]
  >> # These take an arbitrary sized list
  ?> p_max(@a,@b, [1,2,3,4,5])
  => [4, 6, 6, 7, 19]
  >> # And the min
  ?> p_min(@a,@b)
  => [3, 2, 2, 1, 14]
  >> p_min(@a,@b, [1,2,3,4,5])
  => [1, 2, 2, 1, 5]
  >> # Finally, some methods out in the wild for general use:
  ?> max(1,2,3,4,5)
  => 5
  >> min(1,2,3,4,5)
  => 1
  >> product(1,2,3,4,5)
  => 120.0
  >> to_pairs(@a,@b) { |a, b| a * b }
  => [12, 12, 12, 7, 266]
  >> sum_pairs(@a,@b) { |a, b| a * b }
  => 309.0

=== Stored Procedures

  [sirb]$: bin/sirb
  Loading sirb (Statistics + Irb: 0.6.3)
  >> set :add, lambda {|x,y| x + y}, "This is my general-use adder, that adds a set of numbers"
  => "add added"
  >> add 1, 2, 3
  => 6
  >> sirb_help :add
  * add (takes 2 arguments, returns a single value--reduce function)
    This is my general-use adder, that adds a set of numbers
    Source: |x,y| x + y
  => nil
  >> sirb_help

  This is Irb, with some extra libraries and commands loaded.
  You have loaded the following libraries:
    narray
    rgl
    matrix
    rnum
    set
    statisticus
    rbtree
    rubygems
    command runner
    enumerable statistics
    general statistics
    mathn

  You have setup the following commands:

  * add (takes 2 arguments, returns a single value--reduce function)
    This is my general-use adder, that adds a set of numbers
    Source: |x,y| x + y

  You can store a command like this:
          set :command_name, lambda{|list params| command }, "Optional description"

  >> commands
  => [:add]
  >> remove_command :add
  => #<Sirb::Runner:0x23df728 @block=proc {|x,y| x + y}, @name="add", @description="This is my general-use adder, that adds a set of numbers">
  >> commands
  => []
  
=== Functional-style Programming

Sometimes it is useful to have a bit of functional flair when implementing equations.  I've slurped up a bit of that and included it:

  .... Fill these in

== Known Issues

I'm generally dissatisfied with quantile, which I think matches the way that R does their quantile.  However, R is inconsistent, and the community has inconsistent interpretations of how to handle that, so I just used R as the standard for today.

I only mix this into Array right now.  I need to work through the various other classes that I use, and see if this will mix into all of those: Vector, Matrix, Hash, RBTree, etc.

I am a little uncomfortable with my stored procedures library.  I want to review it, because it so aggressively walk on Proc.  There are other ideas out there that I will want to review when I get the chance.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* All the libraries are optional, but every time you log in, you will get a list of libraries that you may want to install.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install davidrichards-sirb
